# ETH-Tools
A Chrome extension that gives access to technical Ethereum tools. Compatible with Ledger devices.

Currently heavily WIP, will add the actual extension here when it is in a better working state.

To run the current avaliable Main.js you will need to install the following packages:

```
npm install @ledgerhq/hw-app-eth
npm install @ledgerhq/hw-transport-node-hid
npm install @ledgerhq/logs
npm install ethers
```
